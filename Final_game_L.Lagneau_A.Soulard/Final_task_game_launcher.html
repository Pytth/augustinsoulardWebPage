<p>You wake up the day after a big party. You don't remember anything. You are in a large dark room. For only light, you have the full moon shining through the window. You get up from the bed and look out the window. You're obviously at the top of a large mansion. You come out of the room and arrive in a large and very dark lane. You move foward into this hallway and arrive at stairs. And suddenly you hear footsteps behind you !</p>
